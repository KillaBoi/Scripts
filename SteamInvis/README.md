# Steam Invisible Settings

These 2 scripts do the following:

- CreateVDF.ps1:
Creates a `localconfig.vdf` file for you with the adjusted `ePersonaState` value set to `7` so you always start in "invisible" mode on Steam.

- ReplaceAllExisting.ps1
Replaces all instances of `ePersonaState` present in currently existing config files to `7` (invisible mode)
